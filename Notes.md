# Multi-Stage Docker Builds

A comprehensive guide to Docker multi-stage builds and their key features.

## Overview

Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile, enabling you to create more efficient and smaller final images.

## Key Features

- Mix and match images as needed for different build steps

### 🎯 Flexible Stage Selection
- You're not limited to using only the stages you've defined
- Copy artifacts from any previous stage

### 🐛 Debug-Friendly

- Use `--target` flag to build up to a specific stage
